Open source projects are awesome because anyone around the world can contribute to their development. This means there's thousands of free Python applications already available for you to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Why should I learn Python? </b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<li><b>Open source.</b> This means lots of community support, fast development, and best of all FREE. No licenses!\n",
    "<li><b>Highly organized.</b> From the code itself to the setup of the projects.\n",
    "<li><b>Jupyter Notebooks:</b> 1) Great for developing workflow 2) Conduct data analysis and have a logbook at the same time 3) Easily shareable (collaborators or your advisor) 4) Interactive plots can be quickly changed to show new information. (See examples: http://seismo-live.org/)\n",
    "<li> <b>Professional development.</b> Even if you don't use it for yourt PhD, you will almost certaintly come across it at some point in your scientific career. Might as well start now.\n",

    "If you're making the switch from Matlab to Python (you're making the right decision!) you can read this article to get a better idea of how the two compare, including the advantages and drawbacks of each: https://pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html. \n",

    "<b> The Bottom Line </b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For now, one important distinction between the two should be made. Matlab is a programming language, a collection of packages written in the Matlab language, and an integrated development environment (IDE) all wrapped into one (The IDE is the thing you write code in when using Matlab). Python is ONLY the language. In order to do science with Python, you need to choose and install your own packages and an IDE. This sounds complicated and is one of the reasons people are afraid to make the transition from Matlab to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, the brave scientists that have made this transition before us have graciously developed ways for newcomers to easily make the transition. They have put together a list of packages we need to use Python for science, some recommended IDEs, and the Python language itself into one installable package. All together, this is known as a Python distribution. For this tutorial, we will be using the Anaconda Python Distribution and its package manager Conda."

Then you decide you want to share it with a colleague. You send the code to them but when they try to run it, it doesn't work because they don't have all the correct versions of packages installed (unresolved dependencies!). This headache can be avoided using environments. With one command you can create a file which will list all the packages and their versions present in your environment. Then when your colleague receives your code they can simply enter a command which will look at the text file and automatically create a new environment with all the required dependencies! \n",
