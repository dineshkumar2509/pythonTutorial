    "Python is a programming language. It's open-source, which means it's completely free and its source code can be viewed by anyone. Open source projects are awesome because everyone around the world can contribute to their development. This means there's thousands of free Python applications already available for you to use. \n",

    "<b> How is Python different from Matlab?</b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "If you're making the switch from Matlab to Python (you're making the right decision!) you can read this article to get a better idea of how the two compare, including the advantages and drawbacks of each: https://pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another comparison (albeit biased towards Python): https://realpython.com/matlab-vs-python/\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> The Bottom Line </b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For now, one important distinction between the two should be made. Matlab is a programming language, a collection of packages written in the Matlab language, and an integrated development environment (IDE) all wrapped into one (The IDE is the thing you write code in when using Matlab). Python is ONLY the language. In order to do science with Python, you need to choose and install your own packages and an IDE. This sounds complicated and is one of the reasons people are afraid to make the transition from Matlab to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, the brave scientists that have made this transition before us have graciously developed ways for newcomers to easily make the transition. They have put together a list of packages we need to use Python for science, some recommended IDEs, and the Python language itself into one installable package. All together, this is known as a Python distribution. For this tutorial, we will be using the Anaconda Python Distribution and its package manager Conda.\n",

    "\n",
    "The list of programs and versions that your project needs in order to work is called its dependencies.\n",
    "Now imagine you have two projects, ProjectA and ProjectB. ProjectA requires Plotly version 3.0 while ProjectB requires Plotly version 4.0. Having two (or more) versions of the same package can quickly screw things up as your computer might not know which version of Plotly to run for a given project.\n",

    "\n",
    "Environments avoid this problem by creating a nice little space separate from everything else in which a unique set of packages can be installed.

Your ProjectA environment can have Plotly 3.0 while your ProjectB environment can have Plotly 4.0, and neither of them will mess up the other one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environments are also helpful for sharing your code with collaborators. Imagine you make a program that cleans up some raw data, organizes it, and plots it. Then you decide you want to share it with a colleague. You send the code to them but when they try to run it, it doesn't work because they don't have all the correct versions of packages installed (unresolved dependencies!). This headache can be avoided using environments. With one command you can create a file which will list all the packages and their versions present in your environment. Then when your colleague receives your code they can simply enter a command which will look at the text file and automatically create a new environment with all the required dependencies! \n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Note on usage:</b> Data scientists like to have an individual environment for each project. Since us physical scientists write less code, it's usually sufficient to have one environment for all your projects. For example, I just have a single environment named 'science.' However, if you know you'll be writing lots of code with different dependencies, it might be better to have multiple environments. The choice is yours!\n"
